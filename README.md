# LeaseCalculator

**Under Development!**

About project:
I created this calculator as a final project to finish my school, Tallinna Polutehnikum in 2023. Class of 2019 (TA-19V).
This was a learning experience where I got acquinted with svelte, elixir and how they work together! This a fun learning experience for me :)
